# EE 271 Final Project 
As a final project for my digital circuit class, I implemented the game FlappyBird on an Altera Cyclone FPGA and a 16x16 LED display. I designed the circuit using SystemVerilog and verify the circuit using ModelSim. The game has a psuedo random pipe generation using a linear shift feedback register. Unfortunately, there are no video demonstration of the game because after the class I lost my access to the 16x16 LED display. Future plan is to re-design the game to work on a VGA display.
